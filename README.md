# GDSC_AI-Data-Augmentation
Use data augmentation to train a convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. You need to perform fine-tuning using pre-trained weights. You are not allowed to train from scratch. Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss, for each epoch. Report the test set accuracy.
