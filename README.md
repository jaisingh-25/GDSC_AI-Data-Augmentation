# GDSC_AI-Data-Augmentation
Use data augmentation to train a convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. You need to perform fine-tuning using pre-trained weights. You are not allowed to train from scratch. Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss, for each epoch. Report the test set accuracy.  
This project contains 2 different varients of Pre-Trained CNN model - 1 which does not utilise Fine Tuning and 1 which utilises Fine Tuning.  
The dataset used to train the CNN model contains 200 images of each, Cats and Dogs, in the training set and 20 images of each, Cats and Dogs, in the test set.
